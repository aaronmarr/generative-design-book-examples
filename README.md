Generative Design Book Examples
===============================

Examples from the book (Generative Design)[http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/]
coded in Racket. 

Instead of using Processing (Java) to explore the examples in the book, I decided to follow along using Racket instead
(because why not). The examples in this repo are based on the examples found in
the book, but will contain my own modifications as I'm primarily interested in
creating static artworks, rather than interactive pieces.
